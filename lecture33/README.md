# Theme and Lang changer
This app is based on `React` framework with the usage of `Typescript`.
The app was composed via `create-react-app`.

The app utilizes `useContext()` hook and other `React` context syntax for theme and site language to modify React components and avoid **_the props drilling problem_**.
